<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Teaching is so rewarding and gives me a sense that I am making the world a bit better place. My name is Md Mehedi Hasan Tusher and I consider myself honored, privileged, and humbled to be a teacher at Port City International University. I earned my bachelor's degree in Textile Engineering with Apparel Engineering major from Daffodil International University in 2014.</p>

<p>In the same year, I started my professional career as a Management Trainee in the Department of Merchandising at Kwun Tong Apparels Ltd. I tried to get acquainted with production patterns and management. I had to be engaged in different activities like planning, forecasting, and selecting production techniques.</p>

<p>Currently, I have been serving Port City International University for the last 5 years as a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Textile Engineering. I selected teaching as the right profession for me to make a profound impact on the industry since my students could spread to the maximum and implement those production methods and management to make a meaningful technical contribution to society. I always give special priority to being acquainted with different teaching methods. I attended a training program on Teaching and Learning at Higher Education organized by the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC) in 2016 and the Faculty Training & Development Program by Port City International University in 2014. For the last five years of teaching, I have been conducting courses in Fibres and polymer Science and Apparel Production and Evaluation which belong to the list of my interest.</p>

<p>Integration of technology in the classroom is my favorite part of teaching. I love to use different visual methods of teaching for the easy learning of students. I engage my students in different long and short-term projects especially relevant to production technique and quality management in the textile industry. Under my supervision students complete several project works every year.</p>

<p>My teaching philosophy is quite simple. I care about my student; care about their dreams and strengths so they can believe in themselves the way I believe in them. Students are the future of a nation and have unlimited value.</p>
